      <h1><strong>My Life</strong></h1>
          <p>Born and raised in Queens, NY. Worked in the kitchen with 
              the aspirations of becoming a great chef and traveling the world to cook
              and experience culture from all over the globe. Changed paths when reality 
              struck and life required more money and a higher paying profession but keeping
              cooking to a life long passion at home. From culinary to tradesman in a couple of 
              months I was quickly on my way onto an HVAC career and moving to California with 
              the person I thought I would spend my life with. While in California I decided
              to follow a career path that has always fascinated me which is th world of coding
              and web development. Thats where i found the <a href="https://bootcamp.extension.ucsd.edu/coding/">UCSD Extension Bootcamp</a>
              and decided to change my life as it was falling apart. Currently back in NY 
              as I try to figure it all out and become a professional web developer and figure out my life.

        <h2><strong>Hobbies</strong></h2>
            <p>Hobbies include cooking every day as it makes my anxiety rest and my mind to relax and 
                focus on just whats in front of me which is the marriage of different ingredients 
                harmonizing into a gorgeous dish that you eat with your eyes and nose before it even 
                gets touched by a fork or a spoon. On a less serious note things i enjoy are playing soccer, boxing, and 
                when i have enough my sky diving as well. Newest hobby to be added to my list that needs to 
                be further practiced to achieve my goals is web development and over all coding.

        <h3><strong>Goals</strong></h3>
            <p>There are many things that I would like to accomplish especially before turning 30 and that would be:
                <ol>
                    <li>Being the best i can be in web development and furthering my knowledge on coding. Hopefully being 
                        capable to get into coding prosthetic limbs or cyber security.
                    </li>

                    <li>Having a food truck that I own and operate on the weekend as 
                        my web development/coding career continues to expand and further in education.
                    </li>

                    <li>Being able to give back to the people that have helped me become who I am today as well as 
                        helping others in any way that i could find whether its through code, food, or just being there
                        for someone that may need help.
                    </li>
                </ol>
